## Test keys

This directory contains two pairs of keys in the right format.

* *Key A* `a.key` contains the private key, `a-spki.pem` contains the
  corresponding public key.

* *Key B* `b.key` contains the private key, `b-spki.pem` contains the
  corresponding public key.

These keys should only be used for testing.
