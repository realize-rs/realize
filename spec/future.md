# Future work

Each section describes a planned change. Sections should be tagged,
for easy reference, and end with a detailled and numbered task list.

## Throttle a TCP connection {#throttle}

The bytes sent per second in a specific TCP connection should be
limited. This should be done by making a RPC call that sets the upper
limit in bytes per second for the bytes they *send*.

The limits are set by the `realize` command on both RPC services and
specified as download and upload limits on the command-line:
--throttle 1M to throttle both to 1M/s, --throttle-up 1M
--throttle-down 512k to throttle upload to 1M/s and download to
512k/s.
