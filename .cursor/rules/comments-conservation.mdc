# Comments Conservation Rule

This rule enforces that all comments (including doc comments and
inline comments) must be preserved during code moves and refactorings.
Comments should be updated if the code they refer to changes, but must
not be removed or lost.

    message: |
      When moving or refactoring code:
      1. Copy all doc comments (///) and inline comments (//) with the code.
      2. Update comments if the code's context or meaning changes.
      3. Never remove comments unless they are clearly obsolete or misleading after the change.
      4. Review all comments after a move/refactor to ensure they are still accurate.

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad: Comments lost during move
      // This function does X
      fn foo() {}
      // ...move foo() to another file, but omit the comment...

      // Good: Comments preserved
      // This function does X
      fn foo() {}

      // Good: Comments updated if needed
      // This function does Y (updated after refactor)
      fn foo() {}
    output: "Always preserve and update comments during code moves and refactorings."
