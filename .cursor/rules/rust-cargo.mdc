description: Rust Cargo and Dependency Management Best Practices
globs: *.rs, Cargo.toml

This rule enforces best practices for Cargo and dependency management in Rust projects.

## Rule Details

- **Pattern**: `Cargo.toml`
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Category**: Dependencies

## Checks

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Use specific version constraints
   - Avoid using `*` or `>=` for versions
   - Use workspace dependencies when appropriate
   - Document dependency purposes
   - When adding a dependency, choose the most recent stable version
   - Make dependency changes as a separate step, that is, make the dependency
     change then run `cargo build` and `cargo test` to make sure the dependency
     did not create any issue - and fix any issues that come up - before
     finally committing the modifications.

2. **Feature Flags**
   - Use feature flags for optional functionality
   - Document feature requirements
   - Use `default-features = false` when appropriate
   - Group related features

3. **Workspace Organization**
   - Use workspaces for related crates
   - Share common dependencies
   - Use path dependencies for local crates
   - Organize crates logically

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Use appropriate profiles
   - Configure build scripts properly
   - Use conditional compilation
   - Document build requirements

## Examples

### Good
```toml
[package]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
description = "A well-documented project"
license = "MIT"

[dependencies]
# Use specific versions with caret
tokio = { version = "1.28", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.10"

# Optional features
my-crate = { version = "0.5", optional = true }

[features]
default = ["my-crate"]
# Group related features
async = ["tokio/async"]
json = ["serde/json"]

[workspace]
members = [
    "core",
    "cli",
    "web"
]

[profile.release]
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"

[build-dependencies]
cc = "1.0"
```

### Bad
```toml
[package]
name = "bad-project"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
# Bad: Using wildcard version
tokio = "*"
# Bad: Using >= for version
serde = ">=1.0"
# Bad: Missing feature specification
log = "0.4"

# Bad: Unorganized features
[features]
feature1 = []
feature2 = []
feature3 = []

# Bad: Missing workspace organization
[workspace]
members = ["*"]
```

## Rationale

Proper dependency management ensures:
- Reproducible builds
- Security through version control
- Efficient dependency resolution
- Clear project organization
