This rule ensures that tests are properly organized and use the public API whenever possible.

      When writing tests:
      1. Use the API of the component under test
      2. Tests should mimic expected usage
      3. Don't add test-only methods to production code
      4. Test the behavior that matters to users
      5. Test helpers in unit tests go in the test module.
      6. Test helpers in integration tests don't need to be tagged with cfg(test)
      7. Add Fixture types in the current tests module to capture
      setup that is common to all or most tests in the module. When
      adding a new test, prefer extending the Fixture to cover the new
      case over re-writing parts of it.
